# Uncertainty

Uncertainty is my newest attempt at creating a programming language from scratch. The initial goal was to create an esoteric programming language that centred largely around random control flow (hence the name uncertainty), but as time went on I decided to evolve the project into a fully-fledged language. My goal here is mostly to learn more about the internal structure of compilers and why they are structured the way they are, as well as to gain some experience in implementing these structures.
